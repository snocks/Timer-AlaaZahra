# Pomodoro timer


## What:
Our project is a timer to break down work into intervals ,so the user insert the duration of his break then the timer count down.


## Why:
We do this project to practice our skills and khnowledge of *TDD* (Test Driven Development).


## How:
We did five steps as following:

**1. Explain the user stories:**
 - when the user open the website , he should insert the break duration that want.
 - when the user click *start* button, timer should start countdown.
 - when the user click *paus* button, timer should stop countdown temporarily.
 - when the user re-click on paus button, timer should continu countdown.
 - when the user click *reset* button, timer should stop count down completly. 
 
**2.Sketch the design:** 

**3.Test stories:**
 - test all the functions are exist(the main function and all the methods).
 - test if the main function return an object.
 - test if the givin input is valid(just positive number not negatinv number nor string).
 - test every function to insure that give the correct output.
 
**4.Write test code synchronously with production code:**

 write the test code function then write the production code which make the test correct.
 
**5.Link the project to the DOM:** 

 So we creat html and css files then connet them with the production code to build website for this project
 
 
## Project plan
  We will put some fetures in this project like:
  - alarm when the countdown is finished
  - timer accepts activity text of what is used for
  - stop-delete timers and history
