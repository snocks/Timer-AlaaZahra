## What:
Our project is a timer to break down work into intervals ,so the user insert the duration of his break then the timer count down.


## Why:
We do this project to practice our skills and khnowledge of *TDD* (Test Driven Development).


## How:
We did five steps as following:

**1. Explain the user stories:**
 - when the user open the website , he should insert the break duration that want.
 - when user click *start* button, timer should start countdown.
 - when user click *paus* button, timer should stop countdown temporarily.
